Accelerates in a ash to clear the line of scrimmage and surprise box players
Home run speed to take the ball to paydirt from anywhere
Makes defenders pay for non perfect pursuit angles

Built low to the ground with thick frame
Lowers pads and grinds through contact arm tackles won t do the job

Outstanding run patience  allows blocking to do its job
Sharp cutback runner  with natural feel for a bigger back
Strong hands on screens and swings  with a knack for making rst man miss
Stout against blitz showed improved awareness in 2024 to scan and square
Created buzz with performance in upset of Notre Dame 225 yards from scrimmage","

Accelerates quickly with enough long speed to take it the distance
Reads blocking scheme well on stretch plays

Flashes burst out of breaks as a route runner
Fumbled just twice over college career
Averaged 21 6 yards on kick returns 19 attempts for 410 yards","


Lean  narrow frame and looks maxed out physically 160 pounds when he arrived in college
Doesn t have build or leg drive to power through resistance

Patient runner who follows blocks to nd slivers of daylight
Knows when to press the hole and work off blocks

Zero fumbles in career
Cerebral player and knows everyone s responsibilities
Former walk on with high character beloved in the LSU program","







Adequate bulk on shorter frame
